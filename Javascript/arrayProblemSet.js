//1. write function printReverse() which takes array as an argument and prints out the elements in reverse order

//printReverse([1,2,3,4]);
//4
//3
//2
//1
//**HINT - use a loop (forEach?)




//2. write function isUniform() - returns true if all elements in array are identical
//**HINT - use loop, and use variable which keeps track of first variable in index. Compare to next item in index. If not equal, escape.




//3. write function sumArray() - accepts an array of numbers and returns the sum of all numbers in the array

//**Hint - use variable which holds result and constantly adds into it each time it loops




//4. write function max() - accepts an array of numbers and returns the max number

//**Hint - use variable which holds max number
